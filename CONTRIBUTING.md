# How to add media?
choose correct sub-repository and send pull-request with **links** on it. Do not upload media to git!

# i've found/created cringy repository!
create [issue](https://github.com/cringelab/cringe/issues) with link and short description. Cringe mantainers will review it, and if there is enough cringe, fork it to Cringe Labs directly
